🎥 OpenCV Projects – Naan Mudhalvan Scheme
📌 About the Repository
This repository is a curated collection of Image Processing, Object Detection, and Real-Time Computer Vision Projects created as part of the Naan Mudhalvan Scheme, an initiative by the Government of Tamil Nadu to empower students with advanced technical skills.

This course was conducted by GUVI | HCL Mentor S. Lakshmi Devi at
🏫 University College of Engineering, Nagercoil.

🚀 Objectives
To introduce students to Computer Vision using OpenCV.
To develop hands-on experience with image and video processing techniques.
To build real-time projects that solve practical problems using Python and OpenCV.
To encourage innovation through object detection and AI-powered vision systems.
